 Runs one instant of @racket[r].

 If @racket[signals] are supplied, they are emitted at the
 start of the @tech{instant}; valued signals must be paired with
 values.

 The result has the values of signals that were emitted.
 Additionally if a signal is not a valued signal and the
 computation depends on it not being present (e.g., if it is
 passed to @racket[present?]), it is included in resulting
 hash, mapped to @racket[#f].
 
 If the code is not constructive, an exception (that is
 recognized by @racket[exn:fail:not-constructive?]) is
 raised.

}

@defform[(debug-when-must e1 e2 ...)]{
 Evaluates @racket[e1] and @racket[e2]s when the entire
 @racket[debug-when-must] form must be executed. Raises an error
 if evaluated outside of an @racket[esterel] form.

 This can be used to debug Esterel in Racket programs.
 Sometimes, code inside @racket[esterel] is run as part of an
 exploration to determine if signal might be emitted and, in
 that case, we do not know that that code must run. In such
 situations, effectful code (such as @racket[printf]) can run
 multiple times, leading to confusing behavior. Wrapping such
 debugging IO operations in a @racket[debug-when-must] form can
 help to understand an Esterel in Racket program.


 In this example, the use of @racket[debug-when-must] prevents
 @racket["hi!"] from being printed out, as that code runs
 only in can exploration. In contrast @racket["bye!"] is printed
 out because that code must run, as @racket[_S1] is not present.
 Note that without the @racket[debug-when-must] forms wrapped
 around the calls to @racket[printf], more printouts happen.
 @examples[
 #:eval esterel-eval

@section{Signals}

@defform[(with-signal (signal ...)

         #:grammar ([signal

                     #:single])]{
 Creates new signals and binds them to the @racket[signal-id]s.

 Each signal suffixed with @racket[#:combine] is a value-carrying
 signal, and those without are not. Multiple emissions of the signal are
 combined using the result of @racket[combine-expr], a binary
 function that is assumed to be associative and commutative.
 If @racket[init-expr] is provided, then the value of the signal
 if it is never emitted is the value of @racket[init-expr]. Once
 the signal is emitted, however, the value of @racket[init-expr]
 is discarded.

 If @racket[#:memoryless] is supplied, the signal's value is
 not carried forward from previous instants, but instead
 restarts with the value of @racket[init-expr]. If
 @racket[#:memoryless] is not supplied, and the signal is not
 emitted in the current instant, then its value is the value
 it had in the previous instant (if it had one).

 If the signal is followed by @racket[#:single], it is also
 a valued signal, but it may be emitted at most once in each
 instant and it takes that value.

 If @racket[with-signal] is invoked from within
 @racket[esterel], then the signals may not be emitted
 once the last @racket[body-expr] is evaluated (it will result in
 an error from @racket[emit] if they are).

 The result of the @racket[with-signal] expression is the
 result of the last expression. If @racket[with-signal] is
 used in the dynamic extent of @racket[esterel], the last
 @racket[body-expr] is not in tail position with respect to
 the @racket[with-signal], but otherwise it is.

}

@defproc[(pause) void?]{

 Pauses the current thread; when all of the threads are
 paused (or they are canceled via @racket[exit-trap]), the
 instant is over. During the next instant, control picks up
 wherever the pause was.


 In this example, we pause in the middle of the loop and
 the value of @racket[n] is carried forward from instant to instant.
 @examples[
 #:eval esterel-eval
 (define-signal S1 #:combine +)

}

@defform[(suspend body-expr when-expr)]{

 When resuming from a @racket[pause] in @racket[body-expr],
 suspends @racket[body-expr] when @racket[when-expr] returns
 a true value. The suspensions also affect any
 @racket[with-signal] forms in (the dynamic extent of)
 @racket[when-expr].

 In the second instant in this example, @racket[S1] is not
 emitted because that thread is suspended. In the third
 instant, however it is, because @racket[S2] is not emitted.

 @examples[
 #:eval esterel-eval
 #:label #f
 (define-signal S1 S2)
 (define r
   (esterel
    (par
     (begin (pause)

 (eval:check (react! r) (hash S1 #t S2 #f))
 (eval:check (react! r) (hash S1 #t S2 #f))

 Signals whose declaration are suspended do not see the
 instants that happen during the suspension. Specifically,
 the pre values are not affected by instants that are unseen
 because of the suspension, as this example demonstrates.
 @examples[
 #:eval esterel-eval
 #:label #f
 (define-signal
   O #:init (set) #:combine set-union
   S2)
 (define r
   (esterel
    #:pre 1

         (loop)))
     (present? S2))))

 (react! r)
 (react! r #:emit (list S2))
 (react! r)
 ]

 In the second instant, @racket[S1] is not emitted but, because its
 declaration is suspended, the present test on the previous
 instant's version of @racket[S1] is true and thus the result
 of @racket[react!] has @racket[O] mapped to @racket[#t].
}

@defform[(with-trap trap-id body-expr ...)]{

 Binds @racket[trap-id] to a newly created trap and evaluates the
 @racket[body-expr]s. If the trap bound to @racket[trap-id] is
 passed to @racket[exit-trap], the computation in the rest of
 the @racket[body-expr]s is skipped and the result of the
 @racket[with-trap] is the value passed to @racket[exit-trap].

 In this example, the @racket[(exit-trap t)] causes the first
 instant to not have @racket[S2] emitted and causes
 the second instant to not have @racket[S1] emitted.

 Creates a separate thread to evaluate the @racket[exec-expr]s.
 Meanwhile, @racket[pause]s until the first instant after the
 @racket[exec-expr]s terminate.

 The @racket[id-expr] expressions are evaluated when the
 @racket[exec] is evaluated and they are bound to the
 @racket[id]s, whose scope spans the @racket[exec-expr]s,
 @racket[kill-expr]s, @racket[suspend-expr]s, and the
 @racket[resume-expr]s.

 The @racket[suspend-expr]s and @racket[resume-expr]s are
 evaluated each instant that the @racket[exec] is
 @racket[suspend]ed or resumed, with the caveat that, if the
 @racket[exec] is suspended for multiple instants, the
 @racket[suspend-expr]s are evaluated only during the first
 instant when the @racket[expr] is suspended. Similarly, when
 the @racket[exec] is resumed, the @racket[resume-expr]s are
 evaluated only once, until the next time the @racket[exec]
 is resumed (following some future suspension).
 
 If the @racket[exec] is terminated (because a parallel
 thread @racket[exit-trap]s to an enclosing @racket[with-trap])
 the @racket[kill-expr]s are evaluated.

 If they are evaluated, the @racket[kill-expr]s,
 @racket[suspend-expr]s, and @racket[resume-expr]s are
 evaluated on the same thread as each other, and that thread
 is different from the thread evaluating the @racket[exec-expr]s.
 Also, the @racket[kill-expr]s, @racket[suspend-expr]s, and
 @racket[resume-expr]s must not raise errors or otherwise
 fail to return normally, as the overall @racket[esterel]
 that they are running in will not function properly in that
 situation.

 The intention of @racket[exec] is to offer a controlled way
 to connect the synchronous computation (inside
 @racket[esterel]) to the asynchronous computation that's
 going on outside it. As such, the idea is that the
 @racket[exec-expr]s may run some asynchronous computation,
 such as connecting to a website or waiting for a timeout
 and, when that completes, trigger another reaction with the
 results of the asynchronous computation communicated to the
 synchronous world via values on signals. That is, the last
 thing that the @racket[exec-exprs]s should do is trigger
 a reaction. But, that reaction should probably be triggered
 on the same thread that triggered the original reaction (or,
 at least, in a way that guarantees that only one reaction is
 running at a time). The syncronization required to establish
 that is left to the user of @racket[exec]. One possibility,
 if a GUI is involved, is to use @racket[queue-callback] in
 the @racket[exec-expr]s, keeping every reaction on an
 eventspace's handler thread.
